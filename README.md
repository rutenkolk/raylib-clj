# raylib-clj

experimental raylib bindings for clojure


## Usage

eventually just a thing on clojars?

There was a need to switch to coffi from dtype-next, but that only really works on jdk-19 right now. Not 20, not 17, no, only 19 right now. Once java 21 releases and the foreign api is stable, coffi will hopefully be updated and all java versions 21 and up will work.

idk what will become of this, so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
